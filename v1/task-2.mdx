<Info>
Most changes are in [v2/index](/v2/index) and one change in [v2/getting-started](/v2/getting-started) where I added a code group.
</Info>

## Why you chose specific components for specific content

- **Interactive components for engagement**: Used accordions and tabs on the v2 index page to let users focus on content they're interested in while reducing clutter from irrelevant information
- **Code groups for multi-language support**: Implemented code groups in the Getting Started page so users can view API integration examples in multiple programming languages

## How your enhancements improve the user experience

- **Organized visual hierarchy**: Unflattened the design using Mintlify's columns and cards to create better organization and make content more scannable
- **Accessible information architecture**: Tabs combined with tables provide clear access to all key information, allowing users to easily navigate between related content sections

## Any custom styling decisions and their rationale

- **HTML tables for flexibility**: Used HTML tables instead of Markdown tables in the key improvements tabs to avoid forced column headers, giving cleaner presentation of content
- **Custom testimonial formatting**: Applied HTML styling to testimonials with cards and structured layout for quote author details (name, title, company), creating a more professional and visually appealing presentation
