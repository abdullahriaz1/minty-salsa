## Your decision-making process

- **Researched Mintlify documentation**: Searched for "multilanguage support" which led to the Navigation > Languages page, then evaluated `languages > groups > version` hierarchy versus a flat 4-group structure (en/fr × v1/v2)
- **Chose hierarchical structure with version dropdown**: Prioritized end-user simplification by isolating languages and using a dropdown for version switching to reduce navigation clutter

## Key user experience improvements

- **Language isolation**: Users only see documentation in their selected language, eliminating irrelevant content and reducing cognitive load
- **Clean version switching**: Dropdown menu provides quick access to v1/v2 without cluttering the sidebar with duplicate navigation entries

## Any trade-offs you considered

- **Version dropdown vs. sidebar sections**: Chose dropdown despite potential benefits of side-by-side comparison for migrating users, since most users focus on one version at a time
- **Hierarchical vs. flat structure**: Selected hierarchical approach over simpler flat structure (4 separate groups) because it scales better with additional languages or versions

## How your structure scales for future growth

- **Easy expansion**: New languages, versions, or content sections can be added without restructuring existing content or affecting other parts of the documentation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation prevents cross-language edits, version dropdown extends to v3+, and structure supports partial translations
